# Copy Command

The copy command is the terminal command to copy a file to a directory into another file. 
My implementation so far, copies content of a file that should exist (for obvious reasons) to another file given the directory is the same or absolute path is given.

## Running
---

```bash
javac cp.java
java cp file1 file2
java cp file1 file2 directory
```
It works for basic copying command.
